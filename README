This Version of the Gen7 Electronics uses an extension board to add SD-card support

Status:

 * motors, endstops, communication with SD-card seem to work fine
 * heater and thermistor still need testing
 * no testprint yet (basically because my printer isn't finished)


Design Goals

 * PCB easily to manufacture on a RepRap.
 * All parts on one board. Except for the Opto Endstops, of course.
 * Enough components to run a Mendel or Huxley with extruder and heated bed.
 * Easy to set up. For example, this would include an USB port.
 * Well available and cheap parts.
 * Based on the ATmega644.
 * Well suited for community driven development. 

Features

 * Single board solution.
 * Single sided PCB.
 * Pololu stepper drivers, exchangeable. // may change to bigger through hole stepper drivers from Toshiba
											to reduce cost and improve heat management
 * 4x stepper motor drivers with 1/16 microstepping.
 * printing from microSD-Card
 * TODO: on-board USB-RS232 converter.
 * Integrated hardware for driving one extruder (stepper, heater and thermistor).
 * Integrated hardware for a heated bed (heater, thermistor).
 * Ready to be hooked up on a generic PC power supply unit (PSU).
 * Use of standard connectors.
 * Debug LEDs for power and both heater outputs.
 * Can turn PSU on and off in software.
 * Reset button.
